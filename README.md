## Description

These lessons are adapted from [a tutorial](https://hbctraining.github.io/GCC-BOSC-2018/) presented by the HBC training team at the [2018 GCC/BOSC conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/). The adaptation is for a 3 hour presentation about RNA-seq (bulk & single cell) experimental design aimed towards G1 students.
