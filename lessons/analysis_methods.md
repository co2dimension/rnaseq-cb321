## QC on sequencing data

The first step in the RNA-Seq workflow is to take the FASTQ files received from the sequencing facility and assess the quality of the sequence reads. 

### Unmapped read data (FASTQ)

The [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) file format is the defacto file format for sequence reads generated from next-generation sequencing technologies. This file format evolved from FASTA in that it contains sequence data, but also contains quality information. Similar to FASTA, the FASTQ file begins with a header line. The difference is that the FASTQ header is denoted by a `@` character. For a single record (sequence read) there are four lines, each of which are described below:

|Line|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|
|2|The actual DNA sequence|
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|

Let's use the following read as an example:

```
@HWI-ST330:304:H045HADXX:1:1101:1111:61397
CACTTGTAAGGGCAGGCCCCCTTCACCCTCCCGCTCCTGGGGGANNNNNNNNNNANNNCGAGGCCCTGGGGTAGAGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGATCTTGG
+
@?@DDDDDDHHH?GH:?FCBGGB@C?DBEGIIIIAEF;FCGGI#########################################################
```

As mentioned previously, line 4 has characters encoding the quality of each nucleotide in the read. The legend below provides the mapping of quality scores (Phred-33) to the quality encoding characters. *Different quality encoding scales exist (differing by offset in the ASCII table), but note the most commonly used one is fastqsanger.*

 ```
 Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHI
                   |         |         |         |         |
    Quality score: 0........10........20........30........40                                
```
 
Using the quality encoding character legend, the first nucelotide in the read (C) is called with a quality score of 31 and our Ns are called with a score of 2. **As you can tell by now, this is a bad read.** 

Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is incorrect. This quality score is logarithmically based and is calculated as:

	Q = -10 x log10(P), where P is the probability that a base call is erroneous

These probabaility values are the results from the base calling algorithm and dependent on how much signal was captured for the base incorporation. The score values can be interpreted as follows:

|Phred Quality Score |Probability of incorrect base call |Base call accuracy|
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------:|-----------------:|
|10	|1 in 10 |	90%|
|20	|1 in 100|	99%|
|30	|1 in 1000|	99.9%|
|40	|1 in 10,000|	99.99%|

Therefore, for the first nucleotide in the read (C), there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance that the base was called incorrectly. Whereas, for the the end of the read there is greater than 50% probabaility that the base is called incorrectly.

### Assessing quality with FastQC

Now we understand what information is stored in a FASTQ file, the next step is to examine quality metrics for our data.

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) provides a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

* Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
* Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
* Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
* Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
* Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

> FastQC has a really well documented [manual page](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) with [more details](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/) about all the plots in the report. We recommend looking at [this post](http://bioinfo-core.org/index.php/9th_Discussion-28_October_2010) for more information on what bad plots look like and what they mean for your data.

> **We also have a [slidedeck](https://github.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/raw/master/lectures/error_profiles_mm.pdf) of error profiles for Illumina sequencing, where we discuss specific FASTQC plots and possible sources of these types of errors.**

The **"Per base sequence quality"** plot is the most commonly used one and it provides the distribution of quality scores across all bases at each position in the reads.

## Expression data :: Normalization and QC

**The next few steps in the analysis are shown in the flowchart below in green**. using your tool of interest.

### Normalization of count data

The first step in the DE analysis workflow is count normalization, which is necessary to make accurate comparisons of gene expression between samples.

The counts of mapped reads for each gene is proportional to the expression of RNA ("interesting") in addition to many other factors ("uninteresting"). Normalization is the process of scaling raw count values to account for the "uninteresting" factors. In this way the expression levels are more comparable between and within samples.

The main factors often considered during normalization are:
 
 - **Sequencing depth:** Accounting for sequencing depth is necessary for comparison of gene expression between samples. In the example below, each gene appears to have doubled in expression in *Sample A* relative to *Sample B*, however this is a consequence of *Sample A* having double the sequencing depth. 

    <img src="../img/normalization_methods_depth.png" width="400">
  
	>***NOTE:** In the figure above, each pink and green rectangle represents a read aligned to a gene. Reads connected by dashed lines connect a read spanning an intron.*
 
 - **Gene length:** Accounting for gene length is necessary for comparing expression between different genes within the same sample. In the example, *Gene X* and *Gene Y* have similar levels of expression, but the number of reads mapped to *Gene X* would be many more than the number mapped to *Gene Y* because *Gene X* is longer.
 
    <img src="../img/normalization_methods_length.png" width="200">
 
 - **RNA composition:** A few highly differentially expressed genes between samples, differences in the number of genes expressed between samples, or presence of contamination can skew some types of normalization methods. Accounting for RNA composition is recommended for accurate comparison of expression between samples, and is particularly important when performing differential expression analyses [[1](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)]. 
 
	In the example, if we were to divide each sample by the total number of counts to normalize, the counts would be greatly skewed by the DE gene, which takes up most of the counts for *Sample A*, but not *Sample B*. Most other genes for *Sample A* would be divided by the larger number of total counts and appear to be less expressed than those same genes in *Sample B*.

***While normalization is essential for differential expression analyses, it is also necessary for exploratory data analysis, visualization of data, and whenever you are exploring or comparing counts between or within samples.***
 
> **Common normalization methods**
> 
> Several common normalization methods exist to account for these differences:
> 	
> | Normalization method | Description | Accounted factors | Recommendations for use |
> | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
> | **CPM** (counts per million) | counts scaled by total number of reads | sequencing depth | gene count comparisons between replicates of the same samplegroup; **NOT for within sample comparisons or DE analysis**  |
> | **TPM** (transcripts per kilobase million) | counts per length of transcript (kb) per million reads mapped | sequencing depth and gene length | gene count comparisons within a sample or between samples of the same sample group; **NOT for DE analysis** |
> | **RPKM/FPKM** (reads/fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads/fragments mapped) | similar to TPM | sequencing depth and gene length | gene count comparisons between genes within a sample; **NOT for between sample comparisons or DE analysis** |
> | DESeq2's **median of ratios** [[1](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)] | counts divided by sample-specific size factors determined by median ratio of gene counts relative to geometric mean per gene | sequencing depth and RNA composition | gene count comparisons between samples and for **DE analysis**; **NOT for within sample comparisons** |
> | EdgeR's **trimmed mean of M values (TMM)** [[2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25)] | uses a weighted trimmed mean of the log expression ratios between samples | sequencing depth, RNA composition, and gene length | gene count comparisons between and within samples and for **DE analysis** |

> *NOTE:* [This video by StatQuest](http://www.rna-seqblog.com/rpkm-fpkm-and-tpm-clearly-explained/) shows in more detail why TPM should be used in place of RPKM/FPKM if needing to normalize for sequencing depth and gene length.


### Quality Control

The next step in the differential expression workflow is QC, which includes sample-level and gene-level steps to perform QC checks on the count data to help us ensure that the samples/replicates look good and to help identify problematic expression trends and outliers.

<img src="../img/deseq_workflow_qc.png" width="200">

#### Sample-level QC

A useful initial step in an RNA-seq analysis is often to assess overall similarity between samples: 

- Which samples are similar to each other, which are different? 
- Does this fit to the expectation from the experiment’s design? 
- What are the major sources of variation in the dataset?

Sample-level QC allows us to see how well our replicates cluster together, as well as, observe whether our experimental condition represents the major source of variation in the data. Performing sample-level QC can also identify any sample outliers, which may need to be explored to determine whether they need to be removed prior to DE analysis. 

<img src="../img/sample_qc.png" width="700">

#### Gene-level QC

In addition to examining how well the samples/replicates cluster together, there are a few more QC steps. Prior to differential expression analysis it is beneficial to omit genes that have little or no chance of being detected as differentially expressed. This will increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes. The genes omitted fall into three categories:

- Genes with zero counts in all samples
- Genes with an extreme count outlier
- Genes with a low mean normalized counts

<img src="../img/gene_filtering.png" width="600">

**DESeq2 will perform this filtering by default; however other DE tools, such as EdgeR will not.**  Filtering is a necessary step, even if you are using limma-voom and/or edgeR's quasi-likelihood methods. Be sure to follow pre-filtering steps when using these tools, as outlined in their user guides found on Bioconductor as they generally perform much better.
